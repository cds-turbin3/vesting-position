//! A narrative demonstration, not a defect.
//!
//! The program forfeits a recipient's *vested but unclaimed* tokens to the
//! creator once the grace window past `end` lapses. This test reproduces that
//! exactly and passes: the behaviour is the design, working as written. It
//! exists to put the behaviour under the report vocabulary so it is legible
//! enough to question, and to hand the maintainer a single artifact that asks:
//! should a fully-vested entitlement be forfeitable at all?
